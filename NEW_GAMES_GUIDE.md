# 🎮 New Interactive Games Guide

## Overview
Added engaging interactive games for **Algebra** and **Geometry** to complement the existing games for other topics!

## 🎯 New Games

### 1. ⚖️ Algebra: Equation Balance Scale

**How to Play:**
1. Click on **Algebra** topic from main menu
2. Select any game mode (Quiz, Puzzle, or Challenge)
3. During the game, you'll see the **Interactive Area** with an equation balance scale

**Features:**
- Visual equation balancing with two sides
- Slider to try different values of x
- Real-time feedback:
  - 🎉 **Green** = Correct! Equation balanced
  - ⬆️ **Yellow** = Too small, increase x
  - ⬇️ **Red** = Too big, decrease x
- "New Equation" button for practice
- Equations like: x + 5 = 12, 2x = 10, x - 3 = 7, etc.

**Educational Value:**
- Helps students understand equation solving visually
- Interactive trial-and-error approach builds intuition
- Immediate feedback reinforces learning
- Shows both sides of equation simultaneously

**Example Equations:**
- Simple: x + 5 = 12 (answer: x = 7)
- Multiplication: 2x = 10 (answer: x = 5)
- With negatives: x - 3 = 7 (answer: x = 10)
- Two operations: 2x + 3 = 11 (answer: x = 4)

## 💡 Tips for Students

### For Algebra:
- Start with a middle value (around 10)
- Watch the feedback messages
- Adjust based on "too big" or "too small"
- Try to solve in your head first, then verify!

### For Geometry:
- Try extreme values (very small and very large)
- Compare different shapes with same dimensions
- Notice which shapes have larger areas
- Remember: doubling a side doesn't double the area!
